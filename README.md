# Sentiment Analysis and AI Algorithms

This repository is focused on learning and implementing various AI and machine learning algorithms from scratch. It includes notebooks with fundamental algorithms, decision tree and logistic regression models, Markov models, and sentiment analysis. The aim of this project is to build a strong foundation in AI concepts and practical implementations.

## Project Structure

- **Basic_Algo.ipynb**: A base file that includes fundamental algorithms as an introduction to AI and machine learning. This file is useful for understanding basic concepts and provides a foundation for more complex algorithms.

- **Decision_Tree_Logistic_Regression_Scratch.ipynb**: Contains code for implementing decision trees and logistic regression from scratch. This notebook walks through the theory and practical application of these popular supervised learning algorithms.

- **Markov_Chain_Hidden_Markov.ipynb**: An implementation of Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models. This notebook explains the concepts behind Markov processes and demonstrates how Hidden Markov Models can be used for sequence prediction tasks.

- **Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb**: A notebook focused on sentiment analysis, a natural language processing task that aims to determine the sentiment behind text data. This file may include techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of machine learning algorithms to classify sentiment.
